# Generic Red and Black Tree 
This is an implementation of a Red and Black tree. A Red and Black tree is a self-balancing binary tree. 
In this implementation the trees element type is generic.

## Performance
One of the main advantages of the Red and Black tree is that it can ensure search, insertion and deletion in logarithmic time. 
The space complexity is O(n).
## Usage 
For a structure to be stored in the RBTree it must implement a few functions, more details can be found in RBTree.h 

## Files
RBTree.c - implementation of a Generic RBTree.\
Structs.c - implementation of a Vector structure and String structure that can be stored in the RBTree.
